# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection
This repository contains a machine learning-based approach for detecting fake news articles. The project aims to combat the spread of misinformation by developing robust models that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake.

**Overview**

The proliferation of fake news on social media and online platforms has become a significant concern, as it can lead to the dissemination of misleading information and potentially harmful consequences. This project leverages advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify fake news articles based on their content and other relevant features.

**Features**

Data Collection: The project includes a comprehensive dataset of real and fake news articles collected from various sources.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data, including traditional algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and ensemble methods like Random Forest, and many more.

Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess their effectiveness in detecting fake news articles.

Deployment: The best-performing models can be deployed as a web application or API for real-time fake news detection.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/hvp-333/Fake-News-Detection.git
2.  Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3.  Explore the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts in the repository to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
4.  Customize the models or experiment with different techniques as needed.
5.  Train and evaluate the models on your own dataset or the provided dataset.
6.  Deploy the trained model using the provided deployment scripts or integrate it into your application.
